Problem Statement

Building and maintaining good habits is one of the most important aspects of personal growth, productivity, and well-being.
However, many individuals struggle with consistency because they lack a simple and reliable system to track their progress.
Existing solutions are often too complex, require internet connectivity, or come with distractions such as notifications and advertisements.  
The absence of a lightweight, distraction-free tool makes it difficult for people to stay accountable to their goals.
Without a clear record of daily progress, habits are easily forgotten, skipped, or abandoned. 
This project addresses that gap by providing a **minimalist, command-line habit tracker** that empowers users to record, monitor, and evaluate their habits in a straightforward way.

 Scope of the Project


The Habit Tracker project is intentionally designed with a **focused scope**:
- It provides **habit creation, tracking, and progress monitoring** without unnecessary complexity.
- It uses a **local text file (`habits.txt`)** for persistence, ensuring offline usability and simplicity.
- The interface is **command-line based**, making it lightweight and platform-independent.
- The scope includes **basic habit management features** such as adding, deleting, resetting, and marking habits as complete.
- It also includes **progress analytics** (percentage of completion) to motivate users.
- While the current scope is limited to daily tracking, the project lays the foundation for future enhancements such as streak tracking, reminders, or integration with visualization tools.
