Project Report: Habit Tracker in Python

1. Introduction
The Habit Tracker is a simple command-line application developed in Python to help users monitor their daily habits.
It allows users to add habits, view their progress, mark habits as completed, and save their progress to a text file (habits.txt).
This project demonstrates the use of file handling, loops, conditional statements, and basic data structures in Python.

2. Objectives

To design a lightweight tool for tracking daily habits.
To practice Python concepts such as:
File I/O operations
Dictionaries for data storage
Exception handling
User input and menu-driven programs
To provide a foundation for more advanced habit tracking applications.

3. System Requirements

Software: Python 3.x
Hardware: Any system capable of running Python scripts
Dependencies: None (uses only built-in Python libraries)

4. Methodology
The project is implemented using the following modules:

a) load_habits()
Reads habits from habits.txt.
Stores them in a dictionary with habit names as keys and their status (done / Not done) as values.
Handles missing file errors using FileNotFoundError.

b) save_habits(habits)
Writes the current habit list to habits.txt.
Ensures persistence of data across sessions.

c) main()
Provides a menu-driven interface:
View Habits
Add Habit
Mark Habit as Done
Exit (and save progress)
Uses a loop to continuously interact with the user until they choose to exit.

Start
   ↓
Load habits from file

Display menu
   ↓
User selects option ────────────────┐
   ↓                                │
View habits / Add habit / Mark done │
   ↓                                │
Repeat menu until Exit              │
   ↓                                │
Save habits to file                 │

End

6. Sample Execution

1. View Habits
2. Add Habit
3. Mark Habit as done
4. Exit
Choose an option: 2
Enter your habit name: Exercise
Added 'Exercise' to your habit list.

1. View Habits
2. Add Habit
3. Mark Habit as done
4. Exit
Choose an option: 3
Enter habit name to mark as done: Exercise
'Exercise' marked as completed!

7. Results
The program successfully tracks habits and saves them in habits.txt.
Example habits.txt after execution:


Exercise,done
Reading,Not done
Meditation,done

8. Limitations
Habits can only be marked as done; no option to delete or edit habits.
Progress is saved only when the user exits via option 4.
No date or streak tracking.

9. Future Enhancements
Add habit deletion and editing functionality.
Track streaks and completion dates.
Provide weekly/monthly progress summaries.
Build a GUI or web-based interface for better usability.
Integrate notifications/reminders.

10. Conclusion
The Habit Tracker project demonstrates how Python can be used to build a practical, menu-driven application with persistent storage.
While simple, it provides a strong foundation for more advanced habit tracking systems and showcases essential programming concepts.
